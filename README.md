# serenity
[WIP] Cozy game for the terminal

### usage
```
make
./serenity
./serenity random
```
/!\ Some terminals are unsupported: terminals that have a problem with ncurses' routines or that have formatting incompatible with proper ncurses execution (ex Qterminal). If the window is solid blue or there are other display inconsistencies, try it in another terminal.\
\
/!\ wip: since this code is under development, some functionalities might be temporarily commented out.
