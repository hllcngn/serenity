# serenity
[WIP] Cozy game for the terminal

### usage
```
make
./serenity
./serenity random
```
/!\ Some terminals are unsupported: terminals that have formatting incompatible with proper ncurses execution (ex Qterminal). If the window is solid blue or there are other display inconsistencies, try it in another terminal.\
\
/!\ WIP: since this code is under development, some functionalities might be temporarily commented out.

### controls
```
= : quit
wasd : movement
```
Keys for actions you can take in game or in menus will be indicated in the interface.
