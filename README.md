# serenity
[WIP] Cozy game for the terminal

### usage
```
make
./serenity
./serenity random
```
/!\ unsupported terminals: terminals that have a problem with ncurses' routines, notably color, or that have formatting incompatible with proper ncurses execution. (ex Qterminal) If the window is solid blue or there are other display inconsistencies, try it in another terminal.\
\
/!\ wip: since this code is under development, some functionalities might be temporarily deactivated. For instance, for ease of testing, lines enabling new game menus might need to be uncommented to enable the expected experience. There might be occasional bugs or crashes, however the game in theory should still be somewhat enjoyable as it is.
