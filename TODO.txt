serenity WIP - TODO.txt

urgent:
v double free on exit
v possibly 1 other segv

new:
- fix maps, houses
- moving through more than 2 maps
- make map int** tp into sth not such a large array
  or merge it with int** inter > rework: entirely merge tp with it
- fixing instances display when overlap
 -> make an array corresponding to the game window
 -> copy map background first
 -> then collisionables
 -> then 
or copy the instances based on their y+h, x, still from the top down
- overlapping interactives bug
- get the code abstraction levels sorted out for ease of programming
- entirely clean code
- figure out frame timer for entities actions & animation
- add in fire animation

important:
~ saving and loading map/world/game
- complex maps
- adapt gameplay to hue
- entities
- inventory

improvements:
- make the map a little bigger so that assets can overlap the edges for a more natural feel
- create functional settings presets
- improve map name generation
~ simplify assets.c using tool functions > functions that will read a whole inter/actionlist from a file
> modular asset files (homogenize all assets into a single struct?)

tweaks:
~ homogenize functions arg order
~ check adding duplicates actions to actionlist


X Complex menus:
- big menu funct (display, hide)
- menu submenus tables
- and state variable (int)
-> submenu object
-> display funct with win, offset & max width
-> display multiple choices as  <  1. pocket  >  and play with the arrows
-> highlight menu objects within a menu panel
-> menu object input handling (calls/then display funct)
-> menu object return set setting
-> and appropriately display current setting
