serenity - TODO.txt
urgent:

new:
> adapt gameplay to hue
2 house
- use of random trees assets
- trees overlap
- overlapping interactives bug
3 mobs
- figure out frame timer for entities actions
x day/night cycle
x deactivate day/night cycle
v modern mode
x scroll decoration

important:
v  basic interface decoration (title screen, in-game....)
-> make the map a little bigger so that assets can overlap the edges for a more natural feel (maybe this will be sorted out with map sculpting)

improvements:
v review start.c
. move actionlist functions to assets.c ?
. simplify assets.c using tool functions
. review drawing.c and game.c
. homogenize functions arg order
. Game structure ?
. why am i not using getline instead of my own fread_line?
   Because I tested all that in the past already, and none of fread, fgets or getline does exactly what I need

tweaks:
- assets name in their files
. improve the code
. use enums


X Menus:
- settings struct
- big menu funct (display, hide)
- menu submenus tables
- and state variable (int)
-> submenu object
-> display funct with win, offset & max width
-> display multiple choices as  <  1. pocket  >  and play with the arrows
-> highlight menu objects within a menu panel
-> menu object input handling (calls/then display funct)
-> menu object return set setting
-> and appropriately display current setting
-> new game submenus 1 names 2 difficulty 3 map size
=> i'm not even sure about the difficulty element (just add everything in)
x ig settings submenus 1 hue
x random hue can be modified through ig settings panel
-> keep changes/discard/apply changes (intermediary settings struct variable)


V Actions: (actions are in lists on instances bc interactives can be modified so that possible actions are modified
	possibly environment changes can affect the available actions on a given interactive.
	this might need to be handled by the player, but i don't see how it could keep track of numerous such modificators
	we can also imagine that depending on player skill, some actions become possible later on in the game.
	also this prevents from hitting the bottom of the array when looking for an action
	to sort this out we could reset an action array when the interactive is modified
	or we could have a table of what interactive got what actions depending on their state.)
-> create table of all actions
-> when loading inter, associate actions


Instances:
-> have a table of all interactive assets to refer to
-> list pointers to unique interactive assets


beyond:
-> unicode
