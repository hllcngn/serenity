serenity WIP - TODO.txt

urgent:
v double free on exit
v possibly 1 other segv

new:
v overlapping interactives bug
- fix how the player can pass through an inter's collision and not detect possible actions if there is another instance on top (prob through making a list of inst at y,x)
v get the code abstraction levels sorted out for ease of programming
- entirely clean code
- figure out frame timer for entities actions & animation
- add in fire animation
- entities

important:
~ saving and loading map/world/game
- complex maps
- adapt gameplay to hue
- inventory

improvements:
- make the map a little bigger so that assets can overlap the edges for a more natural feel
- create functional settings presets
- improve map name generation
~ simplify assets.c using tool functions > functions that will read a whole inter/actionlist from a file
 > modular asset files (homogenize all assets into a single struct?)
  > es

tweaks:
~ homogenize functions arg order
~ check adding duplicates actions to actionlist


Teleports:
x on inter -> create new map upon going through a teleporter
           -> teleporter inter
x on map -> list on tp on map
         -> create bridge map -> map type
         -> or just use a new blank map
x to another map
x to inside a house
x tp skill
- fix maps, houses
 -> complete list of maps on world struct
 -> edit house asset file to make it an inter with tp
 [-> list of houses on map struct (what for? -for reference)]
 [-> change house struct, notably add a list of maps for rooms (mostly useful to set houses on fire)]
 -> add world position to maps, relative position to rooms
    (not sure if necessary, if the maps are implicitly aligned and at scale already)
- remove fg (?) and tp fields from map
- make map int** tp into sth not such a large array
  or merge it with int** inter > rework: entirely merge tp with it
- moving through more than 2 maps
-> portal inter with pointer to map
-> map ids
-> creating 2 maps
or creating map when going through the portal
   activating portals?
or create all maps at the beginning of the game
   especially when game with limited map number?


X Complex menus:
- big menu funct (display, hide)
- menu submenus tables
- and state variable (int)
-> submenu object
-> display funct with win, offset & max width
-> display multiple choices as  <  1. pocket  >  and play with the arrows
-> highlight menu objects within a menu panel
-> menu object input handling (calls/then display funct)
-> menu object return set setting
-> and appropriately display current setting
-> new game submenus 1 names 2 difficulty 3 map size
=> i'm not even sure about the difficulty element (just add everything in)
x ig settings submenus 1 hue
x random hue can be modified through ig settings panel
-> keep changes/discard/apply changes (intermediary settings struct variable)


beyond:
-> unicode


path not taken:
x scroll decoration
x update oldschool mode
x day/night cycle
x deactivate day/night cycle
