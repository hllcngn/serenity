serenity WIP - TODO.txt

urgent:
v double free on exit
v possibly 1 other segv

new:
v overlapping interactives bug
- fix how the player can pass through an inter's collision and not detect possible actions if there is another instance on top (prob through making a list of inst at y,x)
v get the code abstraction levels sorted out for ease of programming
- entirely clean code
- figure out frame timer for entities actions & animation
- add in fire animation
- entities

important:
~ saving and loading map/world/game
- complex maps
- adapt gameplay to hue
- inventory

improvements:
- make the map a little bigger so that assets can overlap the edges for a more natural feel
- create functional settings presets
- improve map name generation
~ simplify assets.c using tool functions > functions that will read a whole inter/actionlist from a file
 > modular asset files (homogenize all assets into a single struct?)
  > es

tweaks:
~ homogenize functions arg order
~ check adding duplicates actions to actionlist


Teleports:
x on inter
-> create bridge map -> map type
x to another map
x to inside a house
x tp skill
- make map->tp into a tp list
- improve movement function
- fix maps, houses
 v> edit house asset file to make it an inter with tp
 -> use this inter
 [-> list of houses on map struct (what for? -for reference)]
 [-> change house struct, notably add a list of maps for rooms (mostly useful to set houses on fire)]
 -> add world position to maps, relative position to rooms
    (not sure if necessary, if the maps are implicitly aligned and at scale already)
    (i mean it's necessary for jumping from the edge of a map, unless you just fall onto a random map)
    ((is there no fall damage?))
- moving through more than 2 maps
- smooth handling of tp inter
-> map ids (?) (when loading (house)?) or map name
- optional max maps number
- activating portals?


X Complex menus:
- big menu funct (display, hide)
- menu submenus tables
- and state variable (int)
-> submenu object
-> display funct with win, offset & max width
-> display multiple choices as  <  1. pocket  >  and play with the arrows
-> highlight menu objects within a menu panel
-> menu object input handling (calls/then display funct)
-> menu object return set setting
-> and appropriately display current setting
-> new game submenus 1 names 2 difficulty 3 map size
=> i'm not even sure about the difficulty element (just add everything in)
x ig settings submenus 1 hue
x random hue can be modified through ig settings panel
-> keep changes/discard/apply changes (intermediary settings struct variable)


beyond:
-> unicode


path not taken:
x scroll decoration
x update oldschool mode
x day/night cycle
x deactivate day/night cycle
