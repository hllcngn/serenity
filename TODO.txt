important:
v basic interface decoration (title screen, in-game....)
- interface decoration: player name

~ simplify assets.c using tool functions
- review drawing.c and game.c
~ homogenize functions arg order
- Game structure ?
~ World structure

- assets name in their files(?)


Instances:

v list pointers to unique interactive assets


V Actions:
v create table of all actions
v when loading inter, associate actions
v actions conditions on ref inter and player
- actions conditions on individual instances
- change lists to realloc arrays?


X Complex menus:
- settings struct
- big menu funct (display, hide)
- menu submenus tables
- and state variable (int)
-> submenu object
-> display funct with win, offset & max width
-> display multiple choices as  <  1. pocket  >  and play with the arrows
-> highlight menu objects within a menu panel
-> menu object input handling (calls/then display funct)
-> menu object return set setting
-> and appropriately display current setting
-> new game submenus 1 names 2 difficulty 3 map size
=> i'm not even sure about the difficulty element (just add everything in)
x ig settings submenus 1 hue
x random hue can be modified through ig settings panel
-> keep changes/discard/apply changes (intermediary settings struct variable)


beyond:
-> unicode
